============

This document was created from the wonderful resources at DIYHRT.info. I have
not checked the information for accuracy other than what was copied over.

Perform DIY HRT at your own risk. While HRT it is one of the safest medical
procedures, any self-adminsistered HRT regiment will come with risks of not
being performed by a trained professional as well as potential legal
rammifications.

With the recent election of Donald Trump and his Heritage Foundation power
structure, as well as the extremely concerning rhetoric coming out of that camp
it is extremely important to stay vigilant. 

Your safety during these trying times is important. Please assess the risk of
performing these actions carefully and weigh them against the needs of your
mental health.


Why this document isn't split into separate documents
======================================================

Look, for some stupid reason the transfemme and transmasc communities like to
fight amongst each other when it comes to representation. I do not understand
this division. This division tends to lead to tthe erasure of transmasc
identities and, with it, the loss of the procedures transmasc people need in
order to survive. I will not allow myself to be part of that erasure.

Combines we are around 1% of the population. There are more Asian people in
the United States (at almost 6%) than there are of us. People who identify as
two or more races account for roughly double our population - 2.3%. The only
populations that have less representation are American Indians, native
Alaskan's, native Hawaiian, other pacific islanders, and "some other race".

We need to support each other. Transfemme's should understand the difficulties
faced by the transmasc communities, and vice-versa. If we understand each other
we can support each other.

Injection supplies #INJ
------------------

Note: All the links for injection needles are for 1 inch needles intended for
intramuscular injection. Please consider using 0.5 inch needles if you wish to
inject subcutaneously. Please remember to dispose of needles in a sharps box or
sturdy plastic container for safety. We recommend 21 to 23 gauge needles for
drawing instead of the standard 18g because it reduces vial coring.

Editors note: Because of the 80 col limitation of this document, some links

Transfemme #TF
==========

What is HTR? #TF-HRT
------------

HRT stands for hormone replacement therapy. For transfeminine people, this
usually means trying to replicate the hormones found in cisgender women. People
who are assigned male at birth (AMAB) will have higher testosterone levels and
lower estradiol (estrogen) levels compared to those assigned female at birth
(AFAB).

The purpose of HRT is to decrease testosterone levels and raise estradiol
levels to levels comparable to that of healthy cis females. This is usually
accomplished using antiandrogens (blocks testosterone and prevents
masculinization) and estradiol (causes feminization).

In this guide, you will see the terms estradiol and estrogen used
interchangeably. Estradiol is the main human female sex hormone, and is a type
of estrogen. Humans also produce other types of estrogens, but these estrogens
are very weak in strength compared to estradiol and not relevant for trans
hormone replacement therapy.

What does it do? #TF-WHAT
----------------

HRT will give a myriad of changes. Here is a chart showing all of the changes
you can expect, along with typical onset times and when effects reach their
maximum. Keep in mind that all forms of HRT will likely make you infertile,
possibly irreversibly. Consider sperm banking if this is a concern.

Effect / Onset / Maximum
D = Days, W = Weeks, M = Months, Y = Years

Body fat redistribution / 1-2M / 2-5Y
Decreased muscle mass / 1-2M / 1-1.5Y
Decreased skin oil / 1-2M / 1-1.5Y
Decreased acne / 1-2M / 1-1.5Y
Skin softening / 1-2M / 1-2Y
Decreased libido / Days to Weeks / Weeks to Months
Decreased random erections / Days to Weeks / Weeks to Months
Erectile Dysfunction / Days to Weeks / Weeks to Months
Breat Development / 2-6W / 2-6Y
Decreased testicular volume / 1-3M / 2-3Y
Decreased sperm production / 2-6W / 1-3Y
Decreased semen volume / 2-6W / 1-3Y
Slowing of facial & body hair / 1-3M / 6-1Y
Voice changes / Training Only / Training Only
Reversal of male pattern hair loss / 1-3M / 1-2Y

Notes:
* Most transfemme's do not experience Erectile Dysfunction.
* HRT will slow facial and body hair growth. Only laser/electrolysis can stop it
    entirely.
* Transfeminine HRT does not cause an effect on an individual's vocal folds.
* Male pattern hair loss can be prevented with HRT, but reversal of hair loss is
    rare.


Accessing Prescribed HRT vs DIY #TF-ACCESS
-------------------------------

* Prescribed HRT * #TF-ACCESS-P

You have to be 18+ to access informed consent services.

Informed consent ensures you understand all the information about a medical
treatment and accept the risks involved. Informed consent in the context of
trans HRT means that the the effects of HRT (including risks and side effects)
are explained to you by a medical professional. You can then agree or refuse
starting HRT. Under an informed consent model, an adult is able to start HRT
very quickly (within days or weeks of the first appointment) after they agree
to receiving HRT treatment.

To save on prescribed HRT in the USA, try goodrx.com for free coupons to use at
participating pharmacies. There are no strings attached to this service! Cost
Plus Drugs is also a good source for affordable medications delivered to you by
mail if you have a doctor’s prescription.

Beyond this point, this guide will focus exclusively on how to safely dose,
source, and administer DIY HRT.


* DIY * #TF-ACCESS-DIY

DIY HRT refers to any HRT that is obtained without a prescription.

Ideally, you would be on prescribed HRT through legit means. However, you may
not have the privilege or means to access prescribed HRT, so this guide may be
of use for you.

If you are willing to attempt DIY, it is a preferable option to not being on
HRT for many. If you do not want to be on waitlists, have to prove your
transness while allowing your body to masculinize, or are unable to get HRT
legally, DIY may be preferable. Depending on where you order from, you may need
to find out how to buy Bitcoin/other cryptocurrencies or find a way to send an
international bank transfer, Moneygram, etc.

In some countries, HRT medications are sold over the counter without the need
for a prescription.

For the majority of individuals, DIY HRT most commonly entails buying
legitimate pharmaceutical-grade medications from foreign companies located in
countries that permit the sale of medications internationally.


* Homebrewed vs Pharmaceutical Grade? * #TF-GRADE

Homebrewed – Refers to HRT produced by individuals, by sourcing raw estradiol
ester/medication/etc powder and compounding the medication themselves. They do
not synthesize (create from scratch) hormones. While the concept sounds scary
there are a couple well respected members of the community that produce high
quality and safe HRT medications. However, homebrew will always carry more
inherent risk, so keep this in mind.

Pharmaceutical grade – Refers to HRT produced by legitimate pharmaceutical
companies that are licensed and subject to regulation. They are the same
quality as those found in your local pharmacy. They can be ordered without a
prescription from companies that are based in countries that allow for the
legal exportation of such medications. These will almost always carry less
inherent risk versus homebrewed hormones.

If you want to acquire DIY injections that aren’t prohibitively expensive or
difficult to source, homebrewed injections are the only options available.

It is highly recommended to always try to order from non-homebrew sources
unless cost or logistical concerns make it unfeasible to order from
pharmaceutical grade sources. Pharmaceutical grade HRT is always safer, and we
highly recommend you choose to buy from these sources. 90%+ of trans feminine
people who are on DIY HRT order from pharmaceutical grade sources.


What forms of estradiol are there? #TF-FORMS
----------------------------------

There are many forms of estradiol, each with their drawbacks, pros, and levels
of ease in terms of obtaining them.

This section does not cover dosing (see the Dosing section for more
information). Given prices are rough estimates for DIY sourced HRT.

Prices below are in $USD. Shipping usually goes between $10-35 USD depending on
the source. It’s best to order at least several months worth at once to offset
the shipping costs.


* Pills – $20-$40 per month ($240-480 per year) * #TF-PILL

By far the most popular and well known, pills are the easiest to come by if you
choose to DIY. Unfortunately, they tend to be somewhat expensive. Choose
bioidentical estrogens (bioidentical means the pills contain the exact same
estrogen produced by human bodies).

Bioidentical estradiol pills usually come in three forms:

Estradiol hemihydrate (e.g. Estrofem, Estrace) is equivalent to estradiol
(mostly sold by homebrewers). Estradiol valerate are another type of estradiol
pill. (ex: Progynova) Estradiol valerate has about 75% of the potency of
estradiol or estradiol hemihydrate.

Avoid non-bioidentical estrogens such as Premarin or Ethinylestradiol (EE).
These carry elevated thromboembolism (blood clot) risks compared to
bioidentical estrogens.

Pills also tend to be quite convenient to take. Also very easy to acquire if
you choose to DIY.

Oral pills:

Oral intake is simply swallowing your pills. Usually twice per day in ~12 hour
intervals. Results in more stable levels versus sublingual/buccal
administration.

Sublingual/Buccal pills:

Sublingual intake refers to placing a tablet under the tongue and letting it
dissolve, and buccal intake refers to placing a tablet between your gum and the
inside of your cheek to dissolve. These two administration methods are
interchangeable and have essentially the same results.

Sublingual/Buccal administration causes higher peak levels of estradiol in the
blood that quickly dissipate. Because of this, it is recommended that
sublingual administration be three (or more) times a day, in 8 hour intervals.


* Transdermal – $30-$45 per month ($360-540 per year)(patches) * #TF-PATCH

Transdermal (estradiol applied to the skin) comes in forms like gels, patches,
solutions, etc.

Patches are typically switched out once to twice a week and are designed to
give out a set dose of estradiol every day. Usually applied to the lower
stomach or upper buttocks.

Prescribed gels typically come in packets or in a pump that dispenses a set
amount each time. Estradiol gels are compounded in an alcohol base to increase
absorption. Usually applied to the skin once per day. Squeeze tube style gels
that aren’t properly dosed are not recommended due to difficulty of accurate
dosing. Unfortunately many gels available from DIY sources are in this
category.

Solutions are usually sold from homebrewers, containing estradiol in an
alcohol-based solution that is applied to the skin, usually in an eyedropper
style bottle.

Estrogen Creams are not very relevant to transfeminine people because of the
low absorption rate into the bloodstream and the difficulty of accurate dosing.


* Injections – $100-$200 per year * #TF-INJ

There are certain esters estradiol is commonly compounded in. Estradiol is
esterified in order to last longer in your body.

Raw estradiol injected into your tissues will very quickly dissipate, which is
why estradiol injections all come in ester form. It’s still just estradiol,
your body just slowly converts it into estradiol from its esterified form.

Estradiol valerate, estradiol cypionate, estradiol enanthate and estradiol
undecylate are the most commonly prescribed and used estradiol esters. They all
have different half lives (time it lasts inside the body before half the
medication is metabolized).

Assuming you inject the same amount of estradiol, esters with shorter half
lives will mean that the levels of estradiol in your blood and tissues will be
higher, but for a shorter period of time.

An ester with a longer half life means you will have to inject more to get to
those same peak levels, but also means you can inject less frequently.

Estradiol Valerate’s (EV) half life is about 3.0 days. EV should be injected
every 5 days.

Estradiol Cypionate’s (EC) half life is about 6.7 days. EC should be injected
every 7 days.

Estradiol Enanthate’s (EEn) half life is about 4.6 days. Although research
suggests that the peak of EEn comes later than EC. Essentially, treat EEn as
similar to EC, with EEn possibly lasting longer. EEn should be injected every
7-10 days.

Estradiol Undecylate’s (EUn) half life is about 30 days. EUn should be injected
every 20-30 days.

Detailed information on estradiol injection dosing will be found later in this
guide in the Estradiol injection dosing section.

Valerate is typically prescribed by doctors, with cypionate being occasionally
prescribed. Cypionate, enanthate and undecylate are most commonly sold by
homebrew estrogen sellers.


* Pellets – N/A * #TF-PEL

Estradiol pellets are implanted into the body (usually the butt) and slowly
release estrogen into your body over the course of many months.

This cannot be found from DIY sources (obviously).

These are more experimental in terms of dosages compared to the other more
common methods. You can get them implanted if your insurance covers it (or if
you’re very wealthy). Because they slowly dissolve and release estrogen over
time, you don’t have to worry about missing a dose.

They last about 3-6 months. Most doctors that offer pellets compound them to
give a patient quite a high dosage of estradiol.


What are the different types of antiandrogens? #TF-TYPES
----------------------------------------------

***********************************************************************
*** Note: All of these should be swallowed unless stated otherwise. ***
***********************************************************************


* Spironolactone (AKA Spiro) – $10-20 per month * #TF-TYPES-SPIRO

Spironolactone is a weak antiandrogen, albeit quite safe. Common side effects
include increased thirst, salt cravings and frequent urination.

Can be taken alongside a regular HRT regimen as an experimental
erection-prevention drug if getting erections is bothersome due to its blood
pressure lowering effects (recommend 100-400mg/day¹ for this (start low)).

Spironolactone is NOT recommended as a first choice of antiandrogen due to its
weak antiandrogenic effects.

If you are currently taking spironolactone, and your total testosterone (T)
levels are under ~30ng/dL, you can almost certainly stop taking spiro at that
point. The estradiol is doing most of the work of suppressing your T.


* Cyproterone acetate (AKA Cypro) – $5-20 per month * #TF-TYPES-CYPRO

Cyproterone is a very effective antiandrogen when combined with estrogen. High
doses should be avoided due to a harsher risk profile.

Keeping under a certain dosage is important, especially considering that
cyproterone is usually sold in dosages 4-8 times that of recommended dosages
for transfeminine individuals (get a pill cutter!).


* Bicalutamide (AKA Bica) – $15-40 per month * #TF-TYPES-BICA

Bicalutamide is a very effective antiandrogen, moreso when paired with
estrogen. It works in a unique way by preventing testosterone from having an
effect on your body, but it does not actually prevent your body from producing
testosterone. Ironically, this will increase your blood testosterone levels
(your body thinks that you have zero testosterone inside you and tells your
testes to produce even more), but don’t worry, all that extra testosterone
can’t do anything.

People tend to report bica being better at preserving penile function, libido
and semen volume better versus other antiandrogens.

In cis male prostate cancer patients, bicalutamide has about a 1/4000 chance of
causing either severe liver or severe lung toxicity. All published case reports
of either severe liver or lung toxicity have been in cis men over 59 years of
age. It is likely that trans women will face a much lower but still present
risk.

It’s strongly recommended to get liver function tests every 3 months if you
take bicalutamide.


* GNRH Agonists – $270 per year (For buserelin) * #TF-TYPES-GNRH

Extremely safe and effective antiandrogens that prevent your testes from
producing testosterone. Commonly referred to as puberty blockers, they work
just as well at blocking T for people who have gone through a full
AMAB/testosterone puberty. Unfortunately the most powerful forms are not
available from DIY sources due to being prohibitively expensive.

An GNRH agonist called buserelin can be found DIY, but its administration
method can be quite annoying (sprayed into the nostrils 3 times a day).


* Estradiol Monotherapy – $100-$200 per year * #TF-TYPES-MONO

Monotherapy means to only use one type of medication. Estradiol monotherapy
uses only high doses of estradiol to suppress your body’s testosterone
production, as estradiol itself functions as an antiandrogen. High enough
levels of estradiol in the body is enough to cause your body’s testosterone
production to lower significantly. This is usually only easily achievable with
estradiol injections, which allow a person to more easily achieve high
estradiol levels versus other methods of administration.

Some people are able to maintain an estradiol monotherapy regimen using
transdermal estrogens, but this is less consistent and more difficult to
achieve. Transdermal estradiol monotherapy is not recommended due to these
reasons.

Attempting estradiol monotherapy using non-injectable or transdermal forms of
estradiol such as pills carry an elevated risk of blood clotting, and we
recommend you do not try this.

The vast majority of people on a decent estradiol injection monotherapy regimen
(only taking estrogen, no antiandrogen) are able to suppress testosterone
levels adequately without needing to take antiandrogens.


Side Effects/Risks #TF-RISKS
------------------

******************
* Important Note *
******************

When you google a medication talked about here, you will probably see a massive
list of side effects, in the context of antiandrogens, most of these effects
(like hot flashes, fatigue, bone density loss, etc.) are actually just side
effects of sex hormone deprivation seen in cis men who take antiandrogens
without an estrogen for the treatment of prostate cancer. You will not see the
effects of sex hormone deprivation if you take estrogen with your
antiandrogens.

All forms of HRT will likely make you infertile, possibly irreversibly.

All recommended tests mentioned in this section can be tested from blood
samples taken during a regular blood test. You don’t have to get fancy
expensive tests.


* Estradiol * #TF-RISKS-EST

All forms of estrogen will increase your risk of blood clots (thromboembolism),
including serious blood clots (e.g. deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism).
The likelihood of this is still very low in absolute risk but it is present.
The risk of getting blood clots on HRT is essentially comparable to that of cis
women if you take a modest HRT regimen.

Higher levels of estradiol means higher blood clot risk.

Assuming the exact same blood levels of estradiol, taking oral estradiol will
carry a higher risk of causing blood clots versus other forms of
administration (due to oral estradiol being metabolized through the liver).

However, because of the higher levels of estradiol in your blood that other
methods usually result in (transdermal, injections, etc.), the unique risks of
oral estradiol aren’t particularly relevant in practice.


* Spironolactone * #TF-RISKS-SPIRO

The main reason spironolactone is not recommended is because spiro is a very
weak antiandrogen. There are just better options out there.

However, it’s very safe, but common side effects include increased thirst, salt
cravings and frequent urination due to it being a diuretic (makes your body get
rid of water faster).

Spiro is also known to reduce blood pressure, which can make it hard for some
people to attain erections.

Ideally you should get U&E (urea and electrolytes) tested for (basically see if
you’re dehydrated) if you are on spiro.

If you are predisposed to developing hyperkalemia (elevated potassium levels),
you should also get your potassium levels tested regularly if you take
spironolactone, as spiro can cause your body to retain more potassium.

For the vast majority of people though, hyperkalemia is not a relevant concern.


* Cyproterone acetate * #TF-RISKS-CYPRO

Extremely high doses of cyproterone, mostly found above 50mg/day and 100mg/day
can increase risks of a myriad of different harsh side effects, mainly
increased risk of prolactinomas and meningiomas (small benign brain tumors).

At dosages relevant to transfeminine people (6.25-12.5mg/day) the risk profile
is much different. The same risks are still present but much lower at smaller
doses.

Cyproterone is also known to slightly increase blood clot risk, although the
increase in risk is quite low at dosages used in trans people.

Cypro may increase the risk of B12 deficiency and slightly increase depression
risk. Despite the relative safety at these doses, ideally you should still get
prolactin (PRL) and B12 tested to make sure it’s within a healthy range. These
risks are cumulative (risks gradually get higher the longer you stay on
cyproterone).


* Bicalutamide * #TF-RISKS-BICA

Due to dysphoria, some transfeminine people do not want to experience a higher
libido and an easier time getting erections. These are things that bica tends
to preserve better than other antiandrogens. Some may see this as a beneficial
effect, however.

The main risk of bicalutamide is severe liver toxicity and lung toxicity. The
chances of either happening are about 1/4000 in cis male prostate cancer
patients. All published case reports of either severe liver or lung toxicity
have been in cis men over 59 years of age. Risk of liver toxicity can be
monitored if you get regular liver function tests every 3 months or so (done by
analyzing blood from a regular blood test sample).

After a year of normal liver function tests, you can stop taking them. The
risks of bicalutamide after a period of time with no side effects are known to
not be cumulative (you can confidently assume that your risk of lung/liver
toxicity will not increase over time if it’s already been a period of time
without symptoms). The risk of both lung and liver toxicity is essentially zero
after a year without issues.

Out of the millions of men who have taken bicalutamide for prostate cancer
treatment, there have been a few reported cases where bicalutamide induced a
severe light sensitivity condition. Again, the risk for this does not seem to
be cumulative after a period of time with no symptoms.

Despite these possible side effects, the absolute risk of any severe outcomes
occurring on bicalutamide is extremely low. With the added benefit that bica
has essentially no common side effects like spiro or cypro.


* GNRH Agonists * #TF-RISKS-GNRH

If you have already gone through an AMAB/testosterone puberty, you will
experience a temporary flareup of testosterone when you start taking a GNRH
agonist for the first time. If you want to avoid this temporary T flare up,
you can take cyproterone or bicalutamide for the first 3 weeks of use. You can
also double the recommended dose of buserelin during the first week (see the
buserelin section under Dosing).

More information on blood testing will be found later in this guide in the
Blood Testing section.

Hormone therapy in general is very safe and effective as long as you take a
reasonable dose.


Dosing #TF-DOSING
------

* Note on HRT dosing *

# For regimens with antiandrogens #

There is usually no reason to start HRT on a lower than normal dose of
antiandrogen, you should go directly onto a standard dose of antiandrogen and
adjust accordingly if needed.


# For regimens with oral or sublingual/buccal estradiol #

To accurately dose pills you may need to buy a pill cutter (Amazon or any local
pharmacy sells them). Check your HRT pill type to see if your pills need to be
split a certain way for your preferred dosages (e.g. if you’re taking 2mg of
estradiol three times a day, and you only have 4mg pills, you will need to cut
your pills into 2mg doses).


# Any regimen #

There’s no strong evidence to suggest that starting on a low dose of estradiol
and slowly raising your dose is necessarily better than starting on a moderate
dose. There are anecdotes and theories floating around that suggest that you
may get better breast development or feminization if you start low and slowly
ramp up your dose. Despite the lack of clinical data and evidence, there’s no
real harm in doing this. Feel free to experiment if you wish.


Antiandrogen + estradiol dosing #TF-DOSING-ANTI
-------------------------------

The following example regimens use typical doses of estradiol on the higher end
of what would be considered a moderate dose. Adjust accordingly if you have
access to blood testing (see blood testing section above).


* Cyproterone acetate * #TF-DOSING-CYPRO

If you take cyproterone, you will need a pill cutter! (Pill cutters are sold at
any pharmacy over the counter or online from sites like Amazon). Cyproterone
tablets are almost always 25mg-50mg tablets (way over a recommended dose). It
is not recommended to go above 12.5mg of cyproterone daily. Increase your
estrogen dosage if testosterone is not adequately suppressed instead.


    * Oral estradiol
        - 6.25-12.5mg cyproterone acetate taken once a day
        - 3mg estradiol swallowed twice per day (total of 6mg daily)
    
    * Sublingual estradiol
        - 6.25-12.5mg cyproterone acetate taken once a day
        - 1mg estradiol taken sublingually/buccally three times a day (total of 3mg/day)

    * Estradiol Patches
        - 6.25-12.5mg cyproterone acetate taken once a day
        - 200μg estradiol patch, changed weekly

    * Estradiol gel
        - 6.25-12.5mg cyproterone acetate taken once a day
        - 4mg of estradiol gel applied to the skin daily


* Bicalutamide * #TF-DOSING-BICA

Reminder! Bicalutamide may cause blood testosterone levels to increase
slightly, so even though your T may be adequately blocked, your testosterone
levels on a blood test will likely show quite high levels. Bicalutamide also
has a long half life, which means it doesn’t really matter what time you take
it every day, as long as you take it every day. 50mg daily is almost always
enough to ensure adequate testosterone suppression when combined with
estradiol.


    * Oral estradiol
        - 50mg bicalutamide taken once a day
        - 3mg estradiol swallowed twice per day (total of 6mg daily)
    
    * Sublingual estradiol
        - 50mg bicalutamide taken once a day
        - 1mg estradiol taken sublingually/buccally three times a day (total of
            3mg/day)

    * Estradiol Patches
        - 50mg bicalutamide taken once a day
        - 200μg estradiol patch, changed weekly

    * Estradiol gel
        - 50mg bicalutamide taken once a day
        - 4mg of estradiol gel applied to the skin daily


* Buserelin * #TF-DOSING-BUSE

Buserelin (sometimes sold as the brand name ‘Suprefact’) has a short half life,
so it should be administered three times a day to be effective. You can double
the recommended dose of buserelin during the first week to counteract the
testosterone flare effect that GNRH Agonists have. Alternatively, you can take
cyproterone or bicalutamide for the first three weeks on buserelin.

Buserelin comes in a bottle that dispenses a set amount of medicine with each
spray (300μg per spray in these examples).
    
    * Oral estradiol
        - 300μg buserelin sprayed into the nostrils three times per day (total
            of 900 μg/day)
 - 3mg estradiol swallowed twice per day (total of 6mg daily)
 
    * Sublingual estradiol
        - 300μg buserelin sprayed into the nostrils three times per day (total
            of 900 μg/day)
        - 1mg estradiol taken sublingually/buccally three times a day (total of
            3mg/day)
    
    * Estradiol Patches
        - 300μg buserelin sprayed into the nostrils three times per day (total
            of 900 μg/day)
        - 200μg estradiol patch, changed weekly
    
    * Estradiol gel
        - 300μg buserelin sprayed into the nostrils three times per day (total
            of 900 μg/day)
        - 4mg of estradiol gel applied to the skin daily


Injection Monotherapy dosing/Accurate injection dosing #TF-DOSING-MONO
------------------------------------------------------

Here are some reasonable dosages for estradiol injections used in transfeminine
hormone therapy:

* Estradiol Valerate (EV): 4mg every 5 days (0.1mL, assuming a 40mg/mL vial)
* Estradiol Cypionate (EC): 5mg every 7 days (~0.13mL, assuming a 40mg/mL vial)
* Estradiol Enanthate (EEn): 5mg every 7 days (~0.13mL, assuming a 40mg/mL
    vial) OR 7mg every 10 days (~0.18mL, assuming a 40mg/mL vial)
* Estradiol Undecyclate (EUn): 12mg every 20 days (0.3mL, assuming a 40mg/mL
    vial) OR 20mg every 30 days (0.5mL, assuming a 40mg/mL vial)

These dosages should give the vast majority of people high enough estradiol
levels to suppress testosterone on its own.

Adjust accordingly if you have access to blood testing (see Blood Testing
section below). Ideally you should be aiming for the lowest possible estradiol
levels (that are still above 100pg/mL at trough) that still adequately suppress
testosterone <50ng/dL at trough. Though people usually require trough estradiol
levels of 200-250pg/mL to adequately suppress testosterone.

(‘Trough’ refers to your blood levels at the lowest point of your dosage
regimen, which is right before you take your next dose. This will be explained
in more detail in the Blood Testing section below)

Vials of estradiol are usually compounded at either 5mg/mL, 10mg/mL, 20mg/mL or
40mg/mL.

This means that for a 40mg/mL vial, every 1mL of liquid will contain 40mg of
estradiol. A 40mg/mL 10mL vial will then contain a total of 400mg of estradiol.

Homebrewed vials are usually compounded at 40mg/mL. We will unfortunately be
doing some math here.

The formula to calculate how much liquid to inject is: (amount you want to
inject) ÷ (concentration of the vial) = amount to inject per dose in mL

Examples:

    - If you wanted to inject 4mg, and you have a 40mg/mL vial,
        4 ÷ 40 = 0.1
        0.1mL per injection

    - If you wanted to inject 5mg, and you have a 40mg/mL vial,
        5 ÷ 40 ≈ 0.13mL
        0.13mL per injection

    - If you wanted to inject 8mg, and you have a 40mg/mL vial,
        8 ÷ 40 = 0.2
        0.2mL per injection

    - If you wanted to inject 10mg, and you have a 40mg/mL vial,
        10 ÷ 40 = 0.25
        0.25mL per injection

    - If you wanted to inject 10mg, and you have a 10mg/mL vial,
        10 ÷ 10 = 1
        1mL per injection

    - If you wanted to inject 10mg, and you have a 20mg/mL vial,
        10 ÷ 20 = 0.5
        0.5mL per injection

Not too complicated now, hopefully!


* How to perform an E injection * #TF-DOSING-INJ

Note: Be sure to dispose of your needle tips inside of a hard plastic container
or a sharps bin to prevent injury!

Cost of needles/syringes – $1-$3 dollars per injection/$50-160 per year
(depends on how much you buy at a time).

Needles can be bought from any pharmacy over the counter in most countries
without a prescription (you may have to ask the pharmacist directly).

Most countries also have online sites that sell appropriate injection needles.
Amazon is a popular source for those in America. You can also check medical
supply sites, which usually have the cheapest prices if buying large
quantities.

Make sure to buy 1mL syringes, as the small amounts of fluid we are using for
each injection are only easily measured with 1mL syringes. The more common 3mL
syringes will still work if you cannot find 1mL syringes, but are not ideal. It
is fine to use 3mL syringes if you are using estradiol undecylate due to the
high injection volumes.1jection, subcutaneous/subq⁶ (injection into
the layer of fat under the skin), and intramuscular/IM (injection deep into the
muscle underneath the skin and fat). Both methods result in identical
absorption rates and levels of the drug, whether you prefer subq or IM is
mostly personal preference.

Homebrewed injections typically contain benzyl benzoate (a safe solvent that is
also commonly used in prescription grade medications), which can cause some
minor irritation if injected subcuaneously. Usually there will be less
post-injection pain if injected intramuscularly.

Appropriate gauges (needle thickness) for a subcutaneous injection are 25-30g,
for intramuscular, 23-25g. Subq needles are thinner than IM needles, which some
people will find less intimidating.

Recommended needle lengths are as follows:
 
 - 1"-1 1/2" (IM, 1 inch is better for thinner people and 1 1/2" for thicker
    people)

 - 1/2"- 3/8" (Subq, up to personal preference)

There are many online videos and guides for how to administer an intramuscular
or subcutaneous injection, here is a decent one: https://bit.ly/3EhvGO3

Very detailed video guides on both IM and subq injections, with the downside
that they are split into multiple long videos.

Editors note: If you cannot find the linked plume video, check out any decent
video hosting site for information on how to perform injections for diabetics
such as insulin injections and follow similar procedures. Although the specific
location you use may be different for injecting estrogen the procedure is
practially the same.

Note that around 0.1mL of fluid will be lost with each injection due to needle
dead space.

Editors note: Some diabetic needles contain 0.003ml of dead space. The needles
recommended here contain around 0.1ml of dead space.


Blood Testing #TF-BTEST
-------------

$50-$150 per test, depending on source

Regular blood testing every ~3 months or so is useful, but not absolutely
mandatory, especially if not particularly affordable or feasible.

Editors note: Blood testing locations provided in resources section above.

International sources for blood testing are unfortunately rare. You can try to
find local private blood testing services or ask a doctor if they can provide
you with the appropriate blood lab requisition forms. Unfortunately, depending
on your circumstances, you may be unable to find a way to get blood tests.

Get your estradiol (E2) and total testosterone (T) tested every time. Get your
blood taken as close as possible to your next scheduled injection/dose (Test
your blood as far away as possible from a previous dose, right before your next
scheduled dose. Preferably the day of your shot, or the day before). Your blood
levels of estradiol and testosterone when taken at this time are called 
"trough levels", because they are the levels of E2 and T that are present in
your body at the lowest point in your HRT dosing regimen.

Trough levels most useful for injection monotherapy; for determining if your
testosterone is adequately suppressed at the lowest point of your injection
cycle.

The most essential component of transfeminine HRT is to get total testosterone
(T) below 50ng/dL and estradiol (E2) above 100pg/mL.

Frequently Asked Questions #TF-FAQ
==========================

* Why do you recommend such low estradiol dosages/levels? *

There’s no clinical evidence that higher estradiol levels results in better
breast development/feminization or a quicker transition. The main factor that
determines how quickly breast growth or feminization occurs is adequate
suppression of testosterone.


* No mention of progesterone (AKA prog)? *

Unfortunately, there’s a lack of clinical evidence that progesterone has any
relevant effects in transfeminine people. Despite this, many people have
anecdotally reported that progesterone usage resulted in better breast
development, higher libido, better feminization, mood changes, etc.
Progesterone does have potentially desirable antiandrogenic effects.

Notwithstanding the lack of evidence for these often-shared anecdotal claims,
there are no serious risks of experimenting with progesterone if you so desire.
Of note is that oral progesterone is mostly destroyed by the liver. The
bioavailability (how much of the medication actually goes into your bloodstream
and tissues) of oral progesterone is less than 2.4%.

In order for progesterone to be maximally effective, rectal administration is
recommended. This significantly increases bioavailability of progesterone.

100mg-200mg of rectal prog daily is a typical dose. Most people take rectal
prog before bed.


* Powers method/Estrone (E1) levels? *

Dr. Will Powers is a trans healthcare provider very well known in the trans
community. He has made many claims about HRT and has a number of unique
practices regarding the HRT regimens he prescribes.

There’s very little evidence to suggest that Powers’ methods are any better at
attaining quicker/better/faster feminization or breast development versus a
typical HRT regimen. There is no clinical evidence that suggests his estrone
theory (higher E1 levels during the start of transition with oral estradiol
causing better breast growth) works any better than other HRT regimens.

The reason Powers’ patients tend to get better results is because he prescribes
regimens and adjusts levels based on blood testing so that the patient’s
hormone levels are actually within reasonable ranges, which is already quite
rare for any trans healthcare provider to do.

Much of what Powers claims/says are mostly unfounded, and there is much
evidence in the contrary for many of his claims. This includes his claims about
boron, progesterone, the ‘Powers’ method’, etc.

Despite this, there are some things that Powers has done that are worthy of
praise, namely the use of bicalutamide as an antiandrogen for transfems, using
high dose estradiol monotherapy, using rectal progesterone instead of oral,
etc.


* What’s the best way of knowing my T levels if I can’t get a blood test? *

Content Warning: NSFW mentions of AMAB genitals

There are really no good ways to find out if your T levels are suppressed if
you can’t access blood tests. If you ejaculate no or very little semen when you
orgasm, it’s a likely sign that your T is very adequately suppressed. However,
being able to ejaculate semen doesn’t necessarily mean your T isn’t being
suppressed.

If you notice your libido being significantly higher than normal, an increase
in acne/oil production, more random erections, and increased semen volume, it
can be a sign that your testosterone is too high.

Try and avoid relying on very subjective factors like changes in mood to gauge
hormone levels.


* Do I have to worry about DHT? *

DHT is an androgen (masculinizing hormone) that causes facial/body hair growth
and contributes to male-pattern baldness. DHT is not mentioned in the main
guide because all HRT regimens that will block/suppress/prevent the effects of
testosterone will also do the same for DHT. Usually it’s not something people
should worry about.

If you are paranoid, you can get your DHT tested with a blood test to see if
it’s too high (anything >20 ng/dL would be considered high). One can add in
0.5mg daily dutasteride (diyhrt.cafe/index.php/Dutasteride) to block DHT.


* Is this illegal? *

Ordering these medications almost always carries zero risk of legal
consequence. This is because in most countries, estrogens and antiandrogens are
not controlled substances that are illegal to order or possess.

However, because ordering medication online without a prescription is
unregulated, packages may still be seized by customs (essentially the border
police that look through mail) and destroyed. Customs seizure is rare though,
and most sellers will resend a package for free or refund an order if it is
seized.

This is how the law works in most countries (including the USA, Canada, UK, EU,
most South American countries, Australia, etc).

However, ordering from a domestic source (usually homebrew sources) will carry
essentially zero risk of seizure, because domestic mail does not pass through
customs.

Some countries, especially in the Middle East like the UAE, do classify HRT
medication as a controlled substance. Research the laws in your country if you
are not certain.


* What do I do if my package is seized? *

In the unlikely event your package is held by customs and you are contacted by
phone or email, do not tell customs what is inside the package. If they contact
you (usually you are only contacted if you provide your contact information to
an overseas pharmacy source), know that you cannot get in legal trouble for
ordering HRT. Contact the seller if possible to resolve the issue.

It is bad for people who want to order from a specific seller, and bad for that
seller’s business if you tell customs that you’re ordering HRT without a
prescription. Don’t do that.


* Traveling with HRT. *

Yes it’s fine to travel with most HRT. Even with weeks worth of needles and
injection supplies. You’ll almost certainly be fine. For air travel, be sure
your HRT is clearly labeled as what it actually is (write the full name of the
medication on the bottle/vial/etc if you need to). Don’t try to take wrongly
labeled HRT onto a plane, for example, putting HRT pills into a vitamin bottle.
If you use injections, store it in your checked baggage.

If you want to be extra safe, throw a bottle of Aspirin and some allergy
medication into a large, clear Ziploc bag along with your HRT.


* Is weight cycling real/worth it? *

Content Warning: Food, Weight, Eating Disorders.

Weight cycling is an idea popular in some transfeminine communities. It is the
idea that losing weight if you are a heavier person pre-HRT, or gaining some
weight if you were a skinnier person pre-HRT can help in obtaining a more
feminine figure/feminine fat distribution and will enhance breast development.

The concept of weight cycling makes intuitive sense, but there has been no
research on the subject. Feel free to try if you want, just don’t hurt yourself
or give yourself an eating disorder.

More extreme forms of weight cycling involve repeatedly gaining and losing
significant amounts of weight. I would not recommend this.


* Do I have to change my HRT regimen if I get an orchiectomy or bottom
surgery/SRS? *

If you no longer have testes, you can take a lower dose of estrogen without an
antiandrogen, because your body no longer produces significant amounts of
testosterone or other androgens, thus negating the need for an antiandrogen.
Below are some more tailored HRT regimens for those who have had an orchi or
bottom surgery/SRS:

* Oral estradiol
    - 2mg estradiol swallowed twice per day (total of 4mg/day)

* Sublingual estradiol
    - 0.5mg estradiol taken sublingually/buccally three times a day (total of
        1.5mg/day)

* Estradiol Patches
    100μg estradiol patch, changed weekly

* Estradiol gel
    - 2.5mg of estradiol gel applied to the skin daily

* Estradiol valerate
    - 2mg every 5 days

* Estradiol cypionate
    - 2mg every 7 days

* Estradiol enanthate
    - 3mg every 10 days


Transmac #TM
========

Introduction to DIY T #TM-INTRO
---------------------

In countries like the USA, UK, Canada, and Australia, accessing DIY
testosterone is typically easier and less expensive compared to DIY estrogen.

This is due to the significant market for testosterone among cisgender men
using it for bodybuilding or performance enhancement, leading to established,
trusted sources within this community.

The kind of testosterone used by trans masculine individuals for hormone
therapy is the same testosterone available through these sources.


Legal Considerations #TM-LEGAL
--------------------

The legal risk of possession of testosterone is very low. Although technically
illegal in countries like the US, authorities rarely prosecute individuals for
personal use. Legal issues might only arise if testosterone is discovered
during an unrelated search.

In countries like Canada and the UK, personal possession of testosterone is
legal, only distribution is prohibited.

Ordering internationally poses a slight risk, as customs may confiscate the
package. However, legal penalties are very rare. Typically, you’ll just receive
a seizure notice. To avoid this, try to order from domestic sources, which are
not subject to customs checks.


What is Testosterone? #TM-TEST
---------------------

Testosterone (T) is an anabolic steroid and masculinizing sex hormone.

Everyone has both estrogen (E) and T, but cisgender men naturally produce more
T than E. We want to achieve the same result through hormone replacement
therapy.


What does it do? #TM-WHAT
----------------

Testosterone induces both androgenic and anabolic effects. Androgenic effects
are the masculinizing changes that come with taking testosterone, which
includes clitoral enlargement (bottom growth), voice deepening, cessation of
menstruation (stopping periods), increased definition of facial features and a
more masculine fat distribution, facial and body hair growth, increased libido,
acne, etc.

You can think of anabolic effects as changes to your body’s metabolism, protein
building and how it uses energy. Anabolic effects include increased muscle mass
and strength, increased bone density, increased appetite, etc.

The androgenic and anabolic effects of testosterone are about equal. You won’t
necessarily have high levels of strength nor gain significant muscle mass,
especially if you don’t exercise regularly.


What kind of methods can I get T in? #TM-METHODS
------------------------------------

There are multiple, each with their upsides and downsides, and levels of ease
in terms of obtaining them.


* Injections * #TM-METH-INJ

By far the most popular and well known method, injections are by far the
easiest to come by if you choose to DIY. They are the easiest to consistently
dose. There are certain esters testosterone is commonly compounded in.
Testosterone is esterified in order to last longer in your body. Raw
testosterone injected into your tissues will dissipate very quickly, which is
why testosterone injections all come in ester form.

Testosterone propionate, cypionate and enanthate are the most commonly
prescribed and used testosterone esters.

We will only focus on cypionate and enanthate due to their long half lives
(amount of time it lasts in your body). Testosterone cypionate and testosterone
enanthate both have very similar strength and half lives.

* Cypionate’s half life is about 8 days when injected.
* Enanthate’s half life is slightly shorter. Treat it similarly to cypionate.
    This means that for most people, it’s best to inject weekly for ideal
    hormone levels.


* Gels * #TM-METH-GEL

This is harder to find in concentrations required to suppress estrogen on the
grey/black market. Also quite expensive if buying DIY. Usually harder to access
because it is rare for most sources to carry gels. Fine for prescribed T.

These come in packets or in a pump.


* Pellets * #TM-METH-PEL

Not available from DIY sources (obviously), but are very effective if you can
find a doctor that offers this form of testosterone.

These are experimental in terms of dosages compared to the other tried and true
methods. You can get them surgically implanted if your insurance covers it (or
you are very wealthy).

They let out a small dose of T each day and you don’t have to worry about
missing a dose. They last about 3-6 months.


Risks/Side Effects #TM-RISKS
------------------

****************************************************************************
* Warning: taking testosterone will likely cause infertility, possibly     *
* irreversibly.                                                            *
****************************************************************************

For a full list of potential increased risks of certain health issues
associated with transmasculine HRT, you can refer to this resource. Most of the
serious side effects are extremely low in absolute risk.

Polycythemia (high concentration of red blood cells in the blood) is a unique
risk for transmascs taking any testosterone therapy. CBC (complete blood count)
tests to monitor your hematocrit (red blood cell count) are recommended.


* What should my CBC look like? *

Polycythemia is defined as serum hematocrit (Hct) or hemoglobin (HgB) exceeding
normal ranges expected for age and sex, typically Hct > 49% in healthy adult
males. So there is no need to worry if you have Hct levels lower than that.


* Aromatization *

In all people, a small portion of the testosterone in their bodies is converted
into estradiol (estrogen) through a process called aromatization. However, in
healthy cisgender males, the testosterone levels typically remain within a
range that does not cause a significant increase in estradiol levels, thereby
mitigating any unwanted feminizing effects. As a transmasculine person, it’s
important to not take too much testosterone (please stay within recommended
dosage guidelines) to prevent estradiol levels from getting too high (which can
cause unwanted feminizing effects).

As long as you take reasonable dosages of testosterone and do not go over the
recommended dosages, you are unlikely to deal with excessive aromatization.


Sourcing/Dosing #TM-SOURCE
---------------

Ideally, you would be on T through legal means. However, you may not have the
privilege, so this guide may be of use for you. Regardless, if you are willing
to attempt DIY, it is a preferable option to not being on T for many.


Prescribed T #TM-SOURCE-PRE
------------

You have to be 18+ to access informed consent services.

Informed consent ensures you understand all the information about a medical
treatment and accept the risks involved. Informed consent in the context of
trans HRT means that the the effects of T (including risks and side effects)
are explained to you by a medical professional. You can then agree or refuse
starting T. Under an informed consent model, an adult is able to start T very
quickly (within days or weeks of the first appointment) after they agree to
receiving T treatment.

To save on prescribed T in the USA, try goodrx.com for free coupons to use at
participating pharmacies. There are no strings attached to this service! Cost
Plus Drugs is also a good source for affordable medications delivered to you by
mail if you have a doctor’s prescription.

Beyond this point, this guide will focus exclusively on how to safely dose,
source, and administer DIY T.


DIY #TM-SOURCE-DIY
---

If you don’t want to be on waitlists, have to prove your transness while
allowing your body to feminize, or are unable to get T legally, then you may
have to order it online. You may need to learn how to buy Bitcoin. (If you are
unable to, get a trusted friend to purchase the Bitcoin for you, or go to your
local BTC ATM.) Some sites also offer payment in methods such as Zelle, Bank
Transfer, Western Union and MoneyGram. (Keep in mind that these methods are
often subject to minimum order requirements, unlike Bitcoin.)

If you choose to order testosterone without a prescription, it will be illegal
in most countries (although the risk of a domestic order being seized, let
alone any person in possession of anabolic steroids for personal use being
prosecuted, is unheard of). Testosterone is legal to possess without a
prescription in places like the UK and Canada (sale of testosterone without a
proper license is illegal, however).


* Dosing (gels) * #TM-DOSE-GEL
Here is a table of typical doses of testosterone gel used in transmasculine
hormone therapy:

T Topical Gel 1% - 12.5-25mg Q AM - 50mg Q AM - 100mg Q AM - Pump or packets
T Topical Gel 1.62% - 20.25mg Q AM - 40.5 - 60.75mg Q AM - 103.25 Q AM
T Axillary Gel 2% - 30mg Q AM - 60mg Q AM - 90-120mg Q AM - Pump only

I recommend people start on ~50mg of testosterone gel per day, up to a maximum
of 100mg/day.

Testosterone gel can be applied to the shoulders and upper arms, or the stomach
area. Thoroughly rub in the gel, and wait until it is completely dry before
putting on clothing or interacting with pets.

I would not recommend you go over 100mg/day unless you have obvious signs of
insufficient T levels after a year on that dosage (still having menstrual
cycles, or a blood test showing inadequate levels).


* Accurate Dosing (injections) * #TM-DOSE-ACC

Here is a table of typical doses of injectable testosterone used in
transmasculine hormone therapy:

Androgen - Low dose - Typical dose - Maximum dose
Cypionate - 20mg/week IM/SQ - 50mg/week IM/SQ - 100mg/week IM/SQ
Enthanate - 20mg/week IM/SQ - 50mg/week IM/SQ - 100mg/week IM/SQ

I usually recommend people start on 50mg/week. You can either choose to slowly
ramp up your dosage, or you can start at a high dose. There is no evidence that
either method is clearly better than the other.

I would not recommend you go over 100mg/week unless you have obvious signs of
insufficient T levels after a year on that dosage (still having menstrual
cycles, or a blood test showing inadequate levels).

Vials of testosterone are usually compounded at either 200mg/mL, 250mg/mL or
300mg/mL. This means that for a 200mg/mL vial, every 1mL of liquid will contain
200mg of testosterone. A 10mL vial will then contain a total of 2000mg of
testosterone.

We will unfortunately be doing some math here. The formula to calculate how
much liquid to inject is: (amount you want to inject) ÷ (concentration of the
vial) = amount to inject per dose in mL

Dosing Examples:

    - If you wanted to inject 20mg and you have a 200mg/mL vial,
        20 ÷ 200 = 0.1
        0.1mL per injection

    - If you wanted to inject 50mg, and you have a 200mg/mL vial,
        50 ÷ 200 = 0.25
        0.25mL per injection

    - If you wanted to inject 100mg and you have a 200mg/mL vial,
        100 ÷ 200 = 0.5
        0.5mL per injection

    - If you wanted to inject 50mg and you have a 250mg/mL vial,
        50 ÷ 250 = 0.2
        0.2mL per injection
 
    - If you wanted to inject 50mg and you have a 300mg/mL vial,
        50 ÷ 300 ≈ 0.17
        0.17mL per injection

Not too complicated now, hopefully!


* How to perform a T injection * #TM-DOSE-INJ

Needles can be bought from any pharmacy over the counter in most countries
without a prescription (you may have to ask the pharmacist directly). Most
countries also have online sites that sell appropriate injection needles.
Amazon is a popular source for those in America.

There are two methods for a T injection, subcutaneous/subq (injection into the
layer of fat under the skin), and intramuscular/IM (injection deep into the
muscle underneath the skin and fat). Both methods result in identical
absorption rates and levels of the drug, whether you prefer subq or IM is
mostly personal preference.

Because of the presence of benzyl benzoate in most steroid site sourced vials,
some people find subcutaneous injections to cause some minor post-injection
pain.

Appropriate gauges (needle thickness) for a subcutaneous injection are 25-30g,
for intramuscular, 23-25g. Subq needles are thinner than IM needles, which some
people find less intimidating.

Recommended needle lengths are as follows:

    - 1"-1 1/2" (IM, 1 inch is better for thinner people and 1 1/2" for thicker
        people)

    - 1/2"- 3/8" (Subq, up to personal preference)

There are many online videos and guides for how to administer an intramuscular
or subcutaneous injection, here is a decent one: https://bit.ly/3EhvGO3

Very detailed video guides on both IM and subq injections, with the downside
that they are split into multiple long videos.

Editors note: If you cannot find the linked plume video, check out any decent
video hosting site for information on how to perform injections for diabetics
such as insulin injections and follow similar procedures. Although the specific
location you use may be different for injecting estrogen the procedure is
practially the same.

Note that around 0.1mL of fluid will be lost with each injection due to needle
dead space.

Editors note: Some diabetic needles contain 0.003ml of dead space. The needles
recommended here contain around 0.1ml of dead space.


Blood Testing #TM-BTEST
-------------

$50-$150 per test, depending on source

Regular blood testing every ~3 months or so is useful, but not absolutely
mandatory, especially if not particularly affordable or feasible.

Editors note: Blood testing locations provided in resources section above.

International sources for blood testing are unfortunately rare. You can try to
find local private blood testing services or ask a doctor if they can provide
you with the appropriate blood lab requisition forms. Unfortunately, depending
on your circumstances, you may be unable to find a way to get blood tests.

Get your estradiol (E2) and total testosterone (T) tested every time. Get your
blood taken as close as possible to your next scheduled injection/dose (Test
your blood as far away as possible from a previous dose, right before your next
scheduled dose. Preferably the day of your shot, or the day before). Your blood
levels of estradiol and testosterone when taken at this time are called 
"trough levels", because they are the levels of E2 and T that are present in
your body at the lowest point in your HRT dosing regimen.


* What should my total testosterone (T) reading be? *

The Endocrine Society’s 2017 clinical guidelines for transgender HRT recommend
that trans men maintain “testosterone levels in the physiologic normal male
range”, a range which is typically given as 300–1000 ng/dL. Slightly higher or
lower testosterone levels above or below this range are not something to worry
about unless your estradiol levels are also too high.


* What should my estradiol (E2) reading be? *

The typical range for adult males is 10 – 50 pg/ml although this varies due to
age and individual factors. Try to aim within this range, although slightly
higher levels are not something to worry about. Try to keep your estradiol
under 70pg/mL

Occasional testing of Complete Blood Count (CBC), Liver Function Tests
(LFT)/Liver enzymes, Clotting factors test, and Lipid profile test
(cholesterol, triglycerides) can be useful to monitor certain health risks
associated with testosterone therapy.

Hormone therapy in general is very safe and effective as long as you take
reasonable doses.

Frequently Asked Questions #TM-FAQ
==========================


Traveling with testosterone.
----------------------------

It is NOT recommended to travel with DIY-sourced testosterone, as airport
security may check through all luggage. If your T vial shows up on a scanner,
you may be charged with possession of a controlled substance.

The absolute risk isn’t very high, but it’s best to try and stay on the safe
side.

If you MUST travel with DIY-sourced T, get a large clear Ziploc bag, have your
T clearly labeled as testosterone, and throw in some aspirin and allergy meds
inside with the T. Most likely airport security will not hound you for a
prescription.

If you are arrested, do not say anything to the police (but don’t make things
up and lie to them) and contact a lawyer as soon as an opportunity is provided
to you.

Obviously, it is fine to travel with legitimately obtained, prescribed T. Just
make sure you have the prescription with you.


Testosterone dosing after a hysterectomy.
-----------------------------------------

Testosterone dosages do not usually need to be adjusted after a hysterectomy.
