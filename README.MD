=== Formatting ===

This project is an old-school eZine, newsletter, whatever you want to call it.
Make sure you wrap your content to 79 characters (80 characters - 1 for
editors with a scroll bar) as this content is meant to be readable on many
devices, including old terminals.

=== Why Old Hardware? ==

Because I like it.

Also, being compatible with older hardware means we can distribute this content
to our fellow trans siblings no matter what their situation is (with the
exception of them being stuck on an old Nokia phone).

=== Why ALL CAPS Directories? ===

I'm an old fart that likes DOS. :)
