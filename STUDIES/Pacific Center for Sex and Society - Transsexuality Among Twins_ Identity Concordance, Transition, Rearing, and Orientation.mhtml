      <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
      <p>The relative contributions of  genetic and environmental factors t=
o the development of gender identity have  been debated. Twins were studied=
 that are concordant or discordant for gender identity  status in order to =
provide clarification of this issue. An extensive library  search yielded r=
eports of 27 male and 16 female sets concordant or discordant  for transsex=
uality. An Internet bulletin board search and clinical contact  requests fo=
r participants in a survey of twins in which one or both  transitioned loca=
ted 69 new twin pairs. In addition to asking about matters  associated with=
 gender, these new twins were asked about their transition,  rearing, and s=
exual practices. Combining data from the present survey with  those from pa=
st-published reports, 20% of all male and female monozygotic twin  pairs we=
re found concordant for transsexual identity. This was more frequently  the=
 case for males (33%) than for females (23%). The responses of our twins  r=
elative to their rearing, along with our findings regarding some of their  =
experiences during childhood and adolescence show their identity was much m=
ore  influenced by their genetics than their rearing.</p>

    <div id=3D"article">
      <p>A letter from a set of  identical twin sisters alerted me that one=
, but not the other, would be  transitioning to live as a man and asking if=
 they might be useful in a study of  transsexuality. With a background in s=
tudying the relationship of twinning and  homosexuality (Whitam, Diamond, &=
amp; Martin, 1993) and uncovering the twins involved  in the John/Joan case=
 (M. Diamond &amp; Sigmundson, 1997) as well as having  reported on conjoin=
ed twins (M. Diamond, 1999) all due to a long term interest  in sexual deve=
lopment (M. Diamond, 1965, 2006, 2011a), immediately piqued  curiosity and =
initiated a search as to previous findings. It became clear that  transsexu=
ality among twins had, indeed, been reported but that no directed  study of=
 the phenomenon had been done. I accepted the twin=92s offer and initiated =
 this study.</p>
      <p>This report is both a review  of previously reported findings and =
the result of a specific research effort to  find twins among whom one or b=
oth had transitioned from their assigned sex at  birth to the gender typica=
l of the opposite sex. Aspects of the twinning  relation and rearing were a=
lso investigated. The findings have relevance to  understanding some of the=
 genetic and social contributions toward the  transsexual phenomenon. This =
subject has been the subject of debate for some  time (Gooren, 1990; Money =
&amp; Gaskin, 1970). Initial abstracts of this research  have appeared (M. =
Diamond, 2011b; &nbsp;M.  Diamond &amp; Hawk, 2004). New material is also i=
ntroduced here regarding  rearing, sexual orientation, and the transition p=
rocess.</p>
      <h3>METHODS &amp; MATERIALS</h3>
      <h4>Twin information from  Available Sources</h4>
      <p>An extensive search for citations regarding transsexual twins  was=
 conducted using standard reference bases such as the Library of Congress, =
Medline  (TR), the National Library of Medicine, and the Institute of Medic=
ine  as well as many &nbsp;others. Also searched  were different video and =
TV sources on the Internet, for example, YouTube, that I thought might lead=
 me to other twin sets.  Transsexuality has been defined as transitioning f=
rom living in the gender  assigned &nbsp;at birth to that of the  opposite =
gender. The condition is also recognized clinically as Gender Identity  Dis=
order or Gender Identity Dysphoria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual=
  of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR; American psychiatric Association, 2000). =
From  the literature or survey only twins age 10 years or older were accept=
ed for our  consideration, since younger children often have doubts about t=
heir sex or gender  and express a desire to change their &nbsp;gender but d=
o not follow through (R. Green, 1987;  Zucker &amp; Bradley, 1995). For tho=
se, not yet fully adult, a clinical  confirmation of the desire and expecta=
tion that such a transition would occur  was accepted as a transition. The =
&nbsp;search  yielded 43 sets of twins from available sources (Tables 1 and=
 2).</p>
      <h4>Twins from Survey</h4>
      <p>Colleagues and transsexual  groups were informed of our interest w=
ith a request to be notified of  appropriate potential subjects. We conside=
red for our study twin persons, male or  female, identical or fraternal, wi=
thin which one or both have transitioned from  female to male (FtM) or male=
 to female (MtF). We also advertised our desire to  study relevant twins by=
 posting our request for subjects on different Internet  websites (see Appe=
ndix). Professional colleagues or others who knew of our  interest referred=
 subjects to us. Responses came from the United States, the United   Kingdo=
m, Australia,  and Japan.  All subjects who personally responded to our sur=
vey were fluent in English. Subject  information from Japan  was received f=
rom an English-speaking colleague. Our call  for new twins  resulted in lea=
ds to 69 new twin sets. The total study thus reports on 112 sets  of twins =
within which one or both had transitioned from one gender to the  other.</p=

      <h4>Survey Questions</h4>
      <p>The survey asked questions of  the twins=92 zygosity, upbringing, =
and gender transition, for example, what was  the age at which the first de=
finite feelings were felt that =93instead of being in  the gender you were =
raised you should have been of the other gender?=94 and =93at  what age did=
 the actual transition occur?=94 The survey stipulated that  transition, fo=
r the purposes of the study, meant =93when one begins to live overtly  and =
fully committed as a member of the opposite gender regardless whether one  =
has had surgery.=94 The survey also asked questions regarding how the twins=
 were  raised as well as of sexual orientation both before and after the tr=
ansition.  For some of these questions we used a Kinsey-like 0 to 6 scale r=
ating system modified  to capture orientation from completely androphilic t=
o completely gynecophilic  (Kinsey, Pomeroy, &amp; Martin, 1948).</p>
      <p>The survey, with a stamped  and addressed return envelope, was mai=
led to each potential subject pair. The  survey consisted of both open- and=
 closed-ended questions with sufficient allowance  for additional comments.=
 Responses were not always forthcoming from both  members of the twin pair.=
 Most often it was the twin that had transitioned that  responded for both.=
 The data presented do not always reflect responses from all  our subjects.=
 As is common in survey research, many respondents chose not to  answer som=
e questions. Where appropriate, the number of those who responded to  any p=
articular question is indicated. When colleagues submitted twin data to us =
 they were often only regarding birth sex, zygosity, and concordance or  di=
scordance of transition. Occasionally there was mention of sexual  orientat=
ion; rarely was there any information regarding the twins=92 rearing.</p>
      <h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
      <p>Statistical analysis for  concordance used the Fisher=92s Exact Pr=
obability Test (Siegel, 1956) and was  conducted in different ways. First, =
we looked at findings from the bibliography  search (Table 3). Second, anal=
yzed were findings from the twin surveys (Table  4), and last we combined t=
he bibliography and survey findings. The combined  data pool (Table 5) resu=
lted in information from 39 monozygotic (MZ) male twins,  21 dizygotic (DZ)=
 male sets, 35 MZ female twin sets, and 17 DZ twin pairs. Six sets  of twin=
s who responded to our survey were brother-sister pairs who were not  inclu=
ded in the total count or statistical analysis.</p>

      <p>Combining data from our  independent findings with those from past=
 research, 13 of 39 male MZ twin pairs  (33.3%) were found to be concordant=
 for transsexual identity and eight of 25  (22.8%) female MZ twins were fou=
nd concordant. In comparison, concordance between  either male or female DZ=
 twins was low or zero (1/38 =3D 2.6%; Table 5).</p>
      <p>Statistical analysis showed  that there exists a significant assoc=
iation between concordance and zygosity  among males (p =3D 0.022) and for =
both sexes (p =3D 0.001) when combining both bibliographic  and survey data=
. More specifically, within this combined data pool there is a  33.33% conc=
ordance among monozygotic male twins compared with a 4.76%  concordance amo=
ng dizygotic male twins. In addition, there is a 28.38%  concordance among =
monozygotic male and female twins compared to a 0.34%  concordance among di=
zygotic male and female twins.</p>
      <p>In the six cases of  brother-sister twins, two males transitioned =
to female and four of the females  switched to live as men. Notably among o=
ur responding twins were three sets who  had been reared apart and were con=
cordant in transitioning. One was a male set  within which the brothers wer=
e separated at birth, another was a set of males  separated at age 4, and t=
he third was a female pair separated at 14. Each had  independently and unk=
nowingly transitioned and found out about each other=92s switch  as adults =
after the gender shift.</p>
      <p>Among 31 of the trans  respondents, the average age claimed for a =
first awareness of being raised  inappropriately and having a desire to be,=
 or of being, of the =93other=94 gender  was 10 years or less for 19 (61.3%=
), with nine (29.0%) claiming it was before  the age of 5. The average age =
of actual transition, however, was 32 years (Mdn.  =3D 33). The concordant =
twins in our study did not always transition at the same time.  In one case=
 the first twin transitioned at 28, while his brother went  male-to-female =
at 39.</p>

      <p>The survey asked respondents  if and when they had discussed their=
 transition with their twin and how they  would characterize the discussion=
. Of the 30 respondents who chose to answer the  question, 11 indicated the=
y had discussed their gender shift prior to their  transition but that it m=
ight have been shortly before having surgery. Five  respondents indicated t=
hey had such a discussion at about the same time the  transition was occurr=
ing, and another six stated they had had ongoing  discussions before, durin=
g, and after the gender shift. Nineteen of 30 (63.3%)  said they felt that =
their twin was supportive and that the talk was congenial.  In contrast, fi=
ve (16.7%) indicated that the talk was tense, confrontational,  or negative=
. Two males  indicated their twin tried to convince them not to  change.</p=
>
      <p>While overall the  nontransitioning twin was supportive, comments =
added by the twins were informative.  A few mentioned that portions of the =
discussion were in regard to how the rest of  the family, particularly the =
father would react. Another twin was concerned  about the community=92s rea=
ction in the small town in which they lived. Two wrote  of the =93grieving=
=94 or =93bereavement=94 their twin experienced. One nontransitioning  twin=
 questioned why his brother was transitioning so late in life, at age 43.  =
One FtM commented that her sister was concerned about how the transition of=
  =93favorite aunt=94 to uncle would affect her daughter. The tenor of most=
 of the  discussions perhaps can be sensed from the comment of one FtM who =
wrote how, at  first, her sister was against the move, but, after coming to=
 understand the  depth of feeling she had for transition, helped her throug=
h the whole procedure.</p>
      <p>One survey question regarding  transition asked, =93Do you think y=
our sexual attraction for a male or female  sexual partner was involved in =
your decision to transition?=94 Respondents could answer  =93Yes=94 or =93N=
o=94 and add a comment. Only two males thought it might have been  involved=
 but none of the other males or females thought so. Many did not even  see =
how the question pertained to them. One female commented she could have  re=
mained a =93happy lesbian=94 if she hadn=92t transitioned. One male comment=
ed that he  was worried about his wife=92s concern that their relationship =
would be seen as  that of two lesbians.</p>
      <h4>Rearing</h4>
      <p>One question of the survey  asked respondents =93Which do you find=
 most true?=94 and gave respondents  subsequent choices to indicate if they=
 thought they were (a) raised  unequivocally as members of their birth sex =
and without allowance for  cross-gendered behavior, (b) in accordance with =
their birth sex with some  permissiveness, or (c) without any gender restri=
ctions. Among 25 male  respondents, 14 (56.0%) indicated they had been rais=
ed unequivocally as boys  without any allowance for cross-gendered behavior=
. This was comparably true for  only four of 20 (20.0%) of our female respo=
ndents. Four males (16.0%) indicated  their parents were permissive of thei=
r behavior, while 50% of the females  indicated their parents were permissi=
ve of their gendered expression, allowing  crossgendered behavior. Only two=
 of the respondent males (8.0%) and four of the  females (20.0%) thought th=
eir parents were not at all restrictive regarding  gendered behaviors.</p>
      <p>A comparable set of questions  asked more specifically if the resp=
ondents thought their parents reinforced  male or female identity and if cr=
oss-gendered behavior, in general, had been encouraged  or discouraged. Bas=
ically almost all of the males and female respondents felt that  their pare=
nts had reinforced the identity associated with their birth sex and  discou=
raged cross-gendered behaviors. Three males and three females, however,  di=
d think their parents encouraged cross-gendered activities. Of the 13 males=
 who  responded to this specific question, nine (69.2%) felt that their par=
ents had  discouraged cross-gendered activities; three did not think so, an=
d one thought  his parents neither encouraged nor discouraged such behavior=
s. Of the 10 females  who responded, one indicated that a male identity had=
 been reinforced and male behavior  was encouraged. Six of the remaining ni=
ne females (67.7%) felt that female  identity was reinforced but that cross=
-gendered behavior was not discouraged.  Among 23 respondents to a question=
 that asked specifically =93Do you think your  parents encouraged cross-gen=
dered behavior?=94 three females and two males  answered yes; all the rest =
(78.3%) said no.</p>
      <p>All survey participants were  asked, =93Were you and your twin tre=
ated similarly?=94 The answer choices were (a)  =93All the time,=94 (b) =93=
Most of the time,=94 (c) =93Some of the time,=94 and (d)  =93Rarely.=94 To =
this crucial question that was answered by 19 males and 19  females, four f=
emales responded =93All the time,=94 and all but one of the  remaining fema=
les (73.7%) responded =93Most of the time.=94 All of the males except  one =
(94.7%) responded =93Most of the time.=94 The one exception responded =93So=
me of  the time.=94 The single male who was separated at birth from his bro=
ther left  this question blank, with a comment regarding his separation. Hi=
s brother had  committed suicide subsequent to transition and prior to havi=
ng received a survey.</p>
      <p>Asked if their parents had  expressed an indication that they wish=
ed the child had been born of the  opposite sex, two of 15 males (13.3%) th=
ought their parents would have  preferred that they had been girls. Five of=
 14 female respondents (35.7%)  thought their parents would have preferred =
that they had been males. Three of these  five were the same three whose pa=
rents had encouraged male behavior. The remaining  22 respondents to this q=
uestion (75.9%), however, indicated that they thought  their parents had no=
 preference regarding their birth sex.</p>
      <h4>Sexual Orientation (Fantasy  and Actuality)</h4>
      <p>The survey, in four separate  questions, inquired about aspects of=
 sexual practice and sexual orientation  (SO) in fantasy and actuality. One=
 question read, =93At present which best  describes your actual sexual part=
ners during any type of actual intercourse?=94  This wording of =93any type=
 of actual intercourse=94 was used in an attempt to be inclusive  of those =
lesbians or others who might have considered for intercourse, only  instanc=
es of =93penis in vagina.=94 The survey asked of both fantasy and actual  p=
ractices, probing whether and how their practice and orientation might have=
  changed before and after their transition.</p>
      <p>Among 15 of 25 transitioning  males that responded to this questio=
n, six reported that, prior to transition,  all or almost all (40.0%) of th=
eir fantasy partners had been males, three indicated  that all had been fem=
ale, and four reported that the majority were female but a  few were male. =
Two respondents reported that in their fantasies they had about  an equal n=
umber of males and females. After transition, in fantasy, 10 (67.8%)  of th=
ese same male respondents stated that all or almost all partners were  male=
s; three males reported having only female partners in fantasy; and two  re=
ported that they were no longer sexually active.</p>
      <p>Regarding actual partners in  intercourse, among the 14 males who =
responded, 10 (71.4%) indicated that all of  their actual partners, prior t=
o transition, were female; two (14.3%) had only had  male partners, and one=
 indicated that most of his partners were female but more  than a few had b=
een male. One male indicated he did not have intercourse prior  to transiti=
on. Regarding actual partners in intercourse after transition, only  11 mal=
es responded. Among these 11, five indicated that all of their partners  (4=
5.5%) had been male, three (27.3%) indicated that all of their partners had=
  been female (the same three that had only females in fantasy), one indica=
ted that  his partners had been mostly male with more than a few females, a=
nd one  indicated that his partners had mostly been female with more than a=
 few males.</p>
      <p>The female-to-male  respondents were asked the same questions as t=
hose who had transitioned male-to-female.  Of the 20 FtM persons in our sur=
vey that answered this question, 14 responded regarding  their fantasy part=
ners. Ten (71.4%), said that prior to transition all or  almost all of thei=
r fantasy partners had been female, two said their fantasies  were equally =
about males and females. Of this same group, one claimed that her  fantasy =
partners had been exclusively male (her real boyfriend), and one  claimed t=
hat her fantasy partners had been mostly male with a few females.</p>
      <p>After transition, the  fantasies of seven FtM respondents (50%) we=
re reported as exclusively or almost  exclusively of females, while three s=
aid their fantasies were equally about males  and females. Among the other =
FtM responders, two reported that their fantasy  partners were usually of m=
ales with more than a few females, and two claimed  that they fantasized mo=
stly about males with a few females.</p>
      <p>Of the actual partners of 14  FtMs who responded to this question,=
 one indicated that prior to transition she  had only had a single male par=
tner (her boyfriend, mentioned above); two  indicated that their partners h=
ad most often been male but they had a few that  were female. Another two r=
espondents indicated that their partners had been  most often female, but t=
hey had more than a few that were male. Eight of these  FtM twins (57.1%) r=
eported that their actual partners prior to transition were  exclusively or=
 almost exclusively female. One FtM indicated that her single  experience w=
ith actual intercourse was a rape after her transition (at age 27)  by a ma=
le who thought she was another homosexual male.</p>
      <p>After transition the FtMs  responded as follows: seven (50.0%) ind=
icated that all of their actual partners  had been female, and another five=
 (35.7%) reported that almost all had been female  with a few males. One Ft=
M indicated that her actual partners were as often male  as female.</p>
      <p>The survey did not  specifically ask respondents about the sexual =
orientation of their twin. From  the comments and answers received, my impr=
ession was that those concurrent in transitioning  were also concordant in =
sexual orientation. The majority of the MZ  transitioning twins, both male =
and female, had siblings who were also  concurrent in sexual orientation. T=
he siblings of the DZ twins, however, were more  often heterosexual than ho=
mosexual. One MZ male who transitioned commented that  his brother was a =
=93straight=94 cross-dresser, and one MZ FtM wrote that her  sister took ma=
le hormones and was a =93masculine dyke.=94</p>
      <h3>DISCUSSION</h3>
      <h4>Twin Concordance and  Familiarity</h4>
      <p>It is clear from the findings  that there is a greater likelihood =
of concordance for transsexuality among  males than among females and a gre=
ater chance of concordance among monozygotic twins  than dizygotic twins. T=
hese findings are consistent with those reported  previously (M. Diamond, 2=
011b; M. Diamond &amp; Hawk, 2004) and comparable to  those found in famili=
al studies and reports of cooccurrence of gender identity disorder  within =
families as reported by others. In a report that appeared while this  paper=
 was in press, Heylens et al. (2012) reported that of 23 MZ female and  mal=
e twins they reviewed, nine were concordant for gender identity disorder (G=
ID;  39%), while none of their 21 DZ twins were concordant. The investigato=
rs  concluded, =93These findings suggest a role for genetic factors in the =
 development of GID.=94 Their results and those reported here are quite sim=
ilar.  The results of these studies combined, at least for this issue, appe=
ar to show  that Internet survey data, when coupled with clinically reporte=
d material, can  provide representative data. Both studies reinforce the si=
gnificant role of  genetics in transsexuality.</p>
      <p>Gomez-Gil et al. (2010) in  their sample of 995 consecutive transs=
exual probands (677 male-to-female and  318 female-to-male) report 12 pairs=
 of transsexual nontwin siblings (nine pairs  of MtF siblings, two pairs of=
 MtF and FtM siblings, and one pair of FtM  siblings). These investigators =
claim that their data indicate that the  probability that a sibling of a tr=
anssexual will also be transsexual was 4.48  times higher for siblings of M=
tFs than for siblings of FtM transsexual  probands, and 3.88 times higher f=
or the brothers than for the sisters of transsexual  probands. Moreover, th=
e prevalence of transsexualism in siblings of transsexuals  (1/211 siblings=
) was much higher than the range expected according to the  prevalence data=
 of transsexualism in Spain (the country of their study).  Their study stro=
ngly suggests that siblings of transsexuals have a higher  chance of being =
transsexual than the general population and that the potential  is higher f=
or brothers than for sisters of transsexuals, and for siblings of MtF  than=
 for FtM transsexuals. An excellent review paper by Veale, Clarke, and  Lom=
ax (2009) offers a host of references of papers dealing with transsexual  f=
amiliarity and, while concentrating on the role of genetics and prenatal  h=
ormones, also touches on the actual and possible aspects of the rearing  en=
vironment. They conclude there appears to be a significant role for biology=
  in transsexualism but conservatively caution that attention is given to  =
rearing practices.</p>
      <p>Other reports have also shown  familial transsexualism. Stoller an=
d Baker (1973) reported on a family in which  two brothers transitioned to =
live as androphilic sisters, and Stoller and Moseley  (1974) reported on th=
ree siblings with GID. Green (2000), in addition to his  report of monozygo=
tic twins that were concordant for transsexualism,  simultaneously reported=
 on nine other siblings or parent-child pairs concordant  for gender identi=
ty disorder. I personally know of three sets of father and son  pairs that =
are concordant for transsexuality. There are no known studies that  report =
any environmental influences significantly able to induce such findings.  R=
esults of testing for GID among the large twin data set of Australia found,=
  =93The model that best described the data included a significant additive=
 genetic  component accounting for 62% of the variance and a non-shared env=
ironmental  component accounting for the remaining 38% of the variance ... =
Overall, the  results support the hypothesis that there is a strong heritab=
le component to  GID=94 (Coolidge, These, &amp; Young, 2002, p251). Bailey,=
 Dunne, and Martin using that  same data set concluded, =93[C]hildhood gend=
er nonconformity was significantly  heritable for both men and women=94 (Ba=
iley, Dunne, &amp; Martin, 2000, p524).</p>
      <h4>Transition</h4>
      <p>The Internet has many  personal reports and stories of transsexual=
s transitioning from one gender to  another with personal recounting of it.=
 Almost all of these tales depict  aspects of the physical changes involved=
. None appears to show or discuss the  emotional interaction this move enge=
nders with others. One documentary movie,  Red Without Blue, does chronicle=
 the close, yet sometimes strained,  relationship between identical twins M=
ark and Alex as Alex undergoes  transformation into a woman (Sebold, Sills,=
 &amp; Sills, 2006). And some books  such as =93Becoming a Visible Man=94 b=
y FtM J. Green (2004) do so.</p>
      <p>Our survey probed this area.  In a number of cases the transition =
was seen as disruptive of the usual  relationship between the twins. Two ma=
les did try to dissuade their brothers from  transitioning. Most of the non=
transitioning twins, however, were supportive.  The majority of the co-twin=
s were aware of the turmoil and distress their  sibling was undergoing or h=
ad gone through. One male said he would get a sex  change even if he =93was=
 seen as the ugliest man or woman in the world.=94 The  nontransitioning tw=
in often was concerned about potential problems for the  brother or sister =
with expressed concerns ranging from religious aspects to  legal issues. Tw=
o of the siblings expressed shock and surprise; others said  they saw it co=
ming. As this paper was in preparation, an article by Riley,  Sitharthan, C=
lemson and Diamond (2011) appeared reporting some of the  difficulties of t=
he transition process that parents experience dealing with a  gender-varian=
t child going through transition. Also, on Mother=92s Day of 2012, a  new b=
ook entitled =93Transitions of the Heart=94 emerged (Pepper, 2012). This bo=
ok contains  a collection of writings from mothers expressing the struggle =
and difficult  experiences of dealing with a transsexual or gender variant =
child. It is  obviously a process needing further study. A book by Segal (2=
000) gives a broad  view of the close and involved relations among twins.</=
p>
      <h4>Rearing</h4>
      <p>While Heylens et al. (2012)  attended to medical records, case rep=
orts, and published aspects of rearing  that might have influenced individu=
als to transition, this study directly asked  the survey respondents involv=
ed different features of their rearing that they  thought might have been s=
ignificant in their gender shift. More than half of  the male respondents c=
laimed that they had been brought up unequivocally in  accordance with thei=
r birth sex without allowance for cross-gendered behavior.  Indeed, nine ma=
les, essentially two of three that answered the related  question, thought =
their parents actively discouraged cross-gendered behaviors.  Parents were =
more permissive with the females; half of the females claimed  their parent=
s had been permissive of their gendered behavior. Three females even  claim=
ed that their parents encouraged cross-gendered behaviors, with one  emphas=
izing that a male identity was reinforced and crossgendered behavior  encou=
raged. No male felt similarly encouraged toward femininity. Only two males =
 claimed that their parents encouraged cross-gendered behaviors. In general=
,  with some leeway for females, there was little indication that our respo=
ndents  were encouraged or supported in their transsexual aspirations. Pare=
nts currently  involved with a transitioning child might, in contrast with =
those of a previous  time, be more supportive of their child=92s cross-gend=
er aspirations.</p>
      <p>Previous investigators have  considered that the relation children=
 have with their mother or father can be  influential in the development of=
 homosexuality and transsexuality. Zucker and Bradley,  for instance, have =
written, =93[T]he influence of parental socialization on  sex-dimorphic beh=
avior, the domain for which clear parental gender  socialization effects we=
re found, is precisely the domain that encompasses many  of the initial beh=
avioral features of gender identity disorder=94 (Zucker &amp;  Bradley, 199=
5, p222). Stoller &nbsp;(1985, p25) wrote,  =93The more mother and the less=
 father, the more femininity.=94 The survey did not  ask responding subject=
s about their relations with their parents or even if  they were reared in =
a single-parent home. However, others have studied such  relationships and =
the findings are not consistent. Green, for instance, (R.  Green, 1987) rep=
orted that boys with GID have greater emotional closeness with  their mothe=
rs than with their fathers. And others such as McCord, McCord, and  Thurber=
 (1962, p361) concluded that =93paternal absence is related to trends towar=
ds a  feminine identification although not necessarily to overt homosexuali=
ty.=94 De  Lange (2011) concluded that father-absent boys show a more femin=
ine or a less  masculine gender identity and report lower self-esteem than =
father-present boys.  But according to Hetherington (1972, p313), =93Few de=
viations in traditional measures  of sex-role typing were obtained.=94 Heth=
erington interviewed, observed, and  tested adolescents without fathers. Sh=
e found few deviations in traditional  measures of sex-role typing. In rega=
rd to transsexuality, =93[n]o difference in  parent-reported gender role be=
havior was found between father-present [and  father-absent] families for e=
ither boys or girls=94 (Stevens, Golombok,  Beveridge, &amp; Team, 2002, p4=
7). This was the conclusion of Stevens, Golombok, Beveridge,  and Team from=
 their study of 283 families with single mothers, 136 without any father  c=
ontact. They further conclude, =93The findings suggest that the gender-role=
  behavior of preschool children develop typically despite the absence of a=
  live-in father figure.=94 (Stevens et al., 2002, p47). In their review of=
 studies  regarding father-absence and transsexual development, Zucker and =
Bradley (1995, p243)  wrote, =93[For children] no simple relation could cha=
racterize the effect of father  absence on gender role development. For fem=
ales, virtually no effects could be  attributed to father absence.=94</p>
      <p>While two male and three  female respondents thought their parents=
 had desired that they had been born of  the opposite sex, none of the othe=
r transsexuals thought so. Buhrich and McConaghy (1978) studied the  questi=
on with groups of homosexuals, transvestites and transsexuals in New Zealan=
d.&nbsp; They found, as found here, that parents of  most children in all g=
roups expressed no preference that the child be of a  particular sex.&nbsp;=
 These investigators  went on to say, =93On the basis that these syndromes =
[homosexuality,  transvestism, and transsexualism] appear to be discrete cl=
inical categories one  would therefore expect to find different patterns of=
 parental influence in the three  syndromes. This was not the case in the p=
resent study=94 (Buhrich &amp;  McConaghy, 1978, p107).</p>
      <h4>Sexual Orientation</h4>
      <p>While the survey specifically  asked each respondent about his or =
her sexual orientation (SO) it did not  directly ask the responding twin to=
 indicate the SO of his or her sibling.  This, however, often became appare=
nt from responses or comments made in  association with other questions. No=
tably, as Heylens et al. (2012) had found,  we too found that of those twin=
s concordant in transition that responded, they were  also concordant in se=
xual orientation. One dizygotic MtF was gynecophilic  before transition and=
 remained so afterward. Commenting on his sexual  experience before the tra=
nsition he said, =93I was very struck by how it seemed more  like 2 women t=
han male/female sex.=94 This study found several of our FtM  respondents re=
porting on their fantasy arousal and sexual encounters with men  indicating=
 that it did not influence them in their decision to transition. This  is i=
n keeping with Coleman, Bockting, and Gooren (1993) who have written of  su=
ch persons. Referring to the belief that female-to-male transsexuals who ar=
e  sexually attracted to men are rare, they report on nine of them. =93Thei=
r  awareness of gender dysphoria preceded their awareness of their attracti=
on  to men. Their wish to undergo sex reassignment as a means of resolving =
their  gender dysphoria superseded any concerns about their sexual orientat=
ion or sexual  adaptation after surgery=94 (Coleman et al., 1993, p37).</p>
      <p>The majority of respondents,  it appears, were attracted to both m=
en and women in both fantasy and actuality.  Such a mix of heterosexual and=
 homosexual fantasies and practices is in accordance  with the fluidity in =
sexual orientation mentioned by Savin-Williams (2006, p116) and  L. Diamond=
 (no relation to the author) and Butterworth, (2008). Savin-Williams  repor=
ted, =93In one study, 100 percent of gay and lesbian adolescents acknowledg=
ed  same-sex sexual attractions and fantasies, but over 80 percent of the g=
irls and  60 percent of the boys also acknowledged heterosexual attractions=
, fantasies  and /or arousal.=94 Kinsey et al. (1948, p510) wrote that =93[=
fantasies] may be  alternately heterosexual and homosexual in the case of t=
he individual who  reacts definitely in both directions.=94</p>
      <p>In regard to transsexualism  among twins, and the findings reporte=
d here and by others, two questions come  to mind. The first is =93Why is t=
here such a significant difference between the MZ  and DZ twins? While ther=
e was concordance for transsexuality among a third of  monozygotic twins fo=
und by search and survey, concordance was essentially zero  for dizygotic t=
wins. Most obviously, the genetic constitution between monozygotic  and diz=
ygotic twins is different. So too might the environmental experiences be  d=
ifferent. But this may also be true for monozygotic twins themselves. Singh=
,  Murphy, and O=92Reilly (2002) discuss and describe epigenetic discordanc=
e between  monozygotic twins and how they may occur. They conclude that the=
se may be more  important than differences in the environment for the twins=
. Relations between  twins has been written of previously (Koch, 1966), but=
 recently many writings  have appeared exploring =93why identical twins mig=
ht be different,=94 (e.g., Bruder  et al., 2008; Fierro, 2012; Kugler, 2005=
; Wade, 2005).</p>
      <p>The second question is =93Why  are there not more concurrent trans=
itions among MZ twins? The majority of MZ  twins, 56%, didn=92t transition =
concurrently. The genetic complement to each of the  twins in a dizygotic p=
air is obviously different and these differences can be  significant. Even =
identical twins, however, are not completely identical in  gene configurati=
ons. Bruder et al. (2008, p763) have reported that copy-number  variation i=
n genome biology can affect differences in behavior between MZ twins  and c=
onclude that =93differences in the genetic makeup between twins derived fro=
m  the same zygote represent an irrefutable example of somatic mosaicism.=
=94 And Martin,  Boomsma, and Machin (1997) present a clear description of =
how a zygote cascades  prenatally through many antenatal environmental effe=
cts and post-zygotic  genetic effects sufficient to dramatically alter trai=
ts between identical twins.  A new book by Segal (2012) fully discusses the=
 genetic consideration regarding  twins and the relative contributions of g=
enetics and the environment. The book,  describing twins reared apart, dram=
atically emphasizes the stronger role genetics  plays relative to the envir=
onment. The pairs of reared-apart twins found in  this study were in keepin=
g with that finding.</p>
      <p>Simpler considerations for  our questions of nonconcordance are av=
ailable. For instance, one has to  consider that not all co-twins have live=
d their full lives, and change may yet  occur. Some of the transitioning tw=
ins are not yet 30, and the mean and median  age for transition we found to=
 be older than that. For one of our twin sets  that was concurrent in trans=
ition, this only could be recorded after 11 years  had passed. And transiti=
ons are known to occur when individuals are in their  70s (Anonymous, 2012)=
 or 80s (Arabiya, 2012). It has also been found in a study  by M. Diamond, =
Watson, &amp; Fee, in preparation), that although people might consider  th=
emselves transsexuals, for many reasons, they don=92t necessarily immediate=
ly  or ever follow through with an anatomical sex change. Prominent reasons=
 for not  transitioning were a real fear of losing spouse, partner, childre=
n, or  employment. And particularly for females, the cost of surgery was of=
ten  prohibitive; either they did not have any way to accumulate the financ=
es needed  or they feared losing their employment rendering them indigent a=
nd homeless.  Many indicated that they were waiting for a parent or spouse =
to die or a divorce  to be finalized before transitioning. In considering t=
wins and the transsexual phenomenon,  it is interesting to recognize that a=
 significant association was recently  found between transsexualism and a g=
enetic allele for male gender identity  (Hare et al., 2009). And Lykken et =
al. (1993), in an extensive review, have presented  evidence for the geneti=
c heritability of many various interests among twins. We  can also combine =
information from studies of brain components in those with GID  that show a=
 relationship to gender.</p>
      <p>Kruijver et al. (2000) found  that the bed nucleus of the stria te=
rminalis (BSTc) of the brain of  male-to-female transsexuals, regardless of=
 sexual orientation, is structurally  similar to that of females. And Zhou,=
 Hofman, Gooren, and Swaab (1995, p68) claim  their brain studies =93suppor=
ts the hypothesis that gender identity [of  transsexuals] develops as a res=
ult of an interaction between the developing  brain and sex hormones.=94 Ch=
ung, De Vries, and Swaab (2002) have shown that in  the development of the =
bed nucleus of the stria terminalis this sex difference  between males and =
females became significant only in adulthood, =93showing that sexual  diffe=
rentiation of the human brain may extend into adulthood (page 1027).=94 Thi=
s  may be associated with late onset of GID. Japanese researchers Yokata,  =
Kawamura and Kameya (2005, p1 of on-line publication  0-7803-6/05/$20.00 @ =
2005 IEEE) have investigated shape differences in the brain=92s  corpus cal=
losum (CC) in cisgendered and transgendered individuals. Their  findings sh=
ow significant differences in the CC shape of typical male and  female brai=
ns and the corpus callosum of transsexuals. They report that the CC  of tra=
nssexuals =93more strongly reflects their mental sex, i.e., gender, than  t=
heir physical sex.=94 And recently Rametti&nbsp;  et al. reported that even=
 before hormone treatment =93female to male  transsexuals (FtM) differ from=
 females but not&nbsp;  from males in several brain fibers (Page 1).=94</p>
      <p>Transsexuals have also been  found to have auditory (Govier, Diamo=
nd, Wolowiec, &amp; Slade, 2010) and  olfactory (Berglund, Lindstr=F6m, Dhe=
jne-Helmy, &amp; Savic, 2008) abilities  that correlate with their desired =
gender more than their birth sex. These  findings offer additional evidence=
 to indicate that transsexualism has a  biologic, nervous-system component =
strong enough to say that gender identity  may be less a matter of choice a=
nd more a matter of biology.</p>
      <p>Gooren (2006, p589) writes,  =93Obviously, male-to-female transsex=
uals, with a normal androgen exposure  prenatally (there is no serious evid=
ence to the contrary) develop a female  gender identity, through unknown bi=
ological mechanisms apparently overriding  the effects of prenatal androgen=
s.=94 The evidence, I believe, is strong enough  to consider transsexuality=
 to be a form of brain intersex (M. Diamond, 2011a). This  is not without c=
hallenge. Meyer-Bahlburg (2011), for instance, thinks the  evidence not yet=
 sufficient and enumerates why he thinks GID is not an intersex  condition.=
 Consider, however, the work of Hare et al. (2009, p93) that has  demonstra=
ted that, genetically, androgen-receptor-repeat-length polymorphism is  ass=
ociated with male-to-female transsexualism and state, =93There is a likely =
 genetic component to transsexualism, and genes involved in sex steroidogen=
esis  are good candidates ... .=94</p>
      <p>In addition the developmental  animal studies of Phoenix, Goy, Ger=
all, and Young (1959), Short (1979), and  Goy, Bercovitch, and McBrair (198=
8) have more than adequately demonstrated that  the behavior (brains) of ma=
mmals can be modified sufficiently to reverse their  gendered/ reproductive=
 behavior without obviously modifying their anatomy.</p>
      <p>It is true, as Meyer-Bahlburg  (2011) criticizes, that studies suc=
h as the work on humans mentioned above need  replication. I agree. But, no=
 studies have been reported that counter these reports,  and my prediction =
is that the findings will be reproduced and transsexualism  will eventually=
 be seen as an intersex variation due to brain (nervous system)  intersexua=
lity. It should perhaps not be surprising that twins share GID as  they do =
other personality characteristics. The similarity of twins to each  other c=
an be remarkable. One classic case reported was of a set of the  so-called =
=93Jim=94 twins <em>reared apart</em>. Although not meeting each other unti=
l late  in adulthood, both had a dog named Toy, had been married twice=97fi=
rst to wives  named Linda and second to wives named Betty; one twin named h=
is son James Allan  and the other named his son James Alan. There were othe=
r mysterious and unique  commonalities (Segal, 2000).</p>

      <h3>APPENDIX</h3>
      <p>Please help if you can! Are  you a twin? Are you transsexual?</p>
      <p>It is now understood that  among twins, there are sets in which bo=
th have transitioned gender  and  other sets in which only one has switched=
. Will you please help us try and find  out why the differences?</p>
      <p>We are looking for twin sets,  male or female, identical or frater=
nal, where one or both have transitioned F2M  or M2F. You are needed for a =
research project to answer a set of questions about  your background and yo=
ur twin=92s condition and transition. The questionnaire  will ask about you=
r development and the circumstances surrounding your and your  twin=92s swi=
tch. Some of the questions will be personal but most are neutral.  Even if =
you are the twin that didn=92t change and your twin the one who did, your  =
answers would be of value. We are trying to find out those features among t=
wins  that have or have not led to gender change.</p>
      <p>The survey will consist of a  set of questions we will mail to you=
 and your twin with a return postage-paid  envelope. Answering the question=
s will take about one to two hours of time.  Twins are welcome from outside=
 the USA as well as within. Everything  will be confidential and nothing wi=
ll be identified with any particular person.</p>
      <p>When the survey is completed  the information gathered will be com=
piled, analyzed, and distributed to those  in transsexual self-help groups =
and, via professional publications, to those in  the helping professions. W=
e desire to improve the lives of persons touched by  the condition.</p>
      <p>If you are willing to help,  please get in touch with Dr. Milton D=
iamond of the University  of Hawaii, School of Medicine.  By mail: 1951 Eas=
t-West Road,   Honolulu, Hawaii   96822, USA;  By email: diamond@hawaii.edu=
